This project was created for Advanced Computer Graphics class at Bennington College fall of 2019. Given the principles of 3D graphics engineering 
and psuedo code examples, students coded a 3D graphics engine in their language of choice. Mine goes up to basic 3d primitive rendering with specular lighting.
It was modified to be used as a tool to do linear algebra processing to help with linear algebra homework the next term and so is not set up in working condition for 
rendering. However, example renders (and fun render errors along the way) are included under /Renders
